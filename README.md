# 42 Cursus

This repository contains my journey through the [42 Network] curriculum.  
The **42 cursus** is a peer-to-peer, project-based learning program that focuses on problem solving, self-learning, and teamwork.  

---

## 📚 About the 42 Cursus
- No teachers, no formal classes – everything is project-based.
- Learn by doing: C, C++, Shell, Algorithms, Graphics, Web, Security, etc.
- Emphasis on **teamwork, autonomy, and resilience**.
- Long-term program designed to prepare you for real-world software engineering.
