# ðŸ“š Libft

`libft` is a custom C library that replicates and extends functions from the standard C library. Built entirely from scratch, it includes memory and string manipulation functions, character checks, and a full suite of singly linked list operations.

This project is part of the [42 School] core curriculum and serves as a foundational step into low-level programming in C.
